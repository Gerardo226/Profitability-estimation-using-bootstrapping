## Goal
Develop a linear regression model for the OilyGiant mining company that would analyze oil well parameters in each of the three selected regions and predict the volume of reserves in the new wells for each region;
Based on these predictions, pick the region with the highest total profit and the lowest risk of losses.
## This project includes the following steps:
Descriptive statistics;
Model development for each region;
Profit calculations;
